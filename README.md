# fullstack_template

This is a template build for myself that contains vite as frontend and esbuild + nodemon on backend. Runs using TS in both frontend and backend. From the root directory, run the command `npm run dev` to start development server for both backend and frontend.

To install all dependencies, run `npm run installAll` from the root directory.

The basic folder structure looks like this:

```
fs-template/
├── backend/
│   └── dev-build.js
├── frontend/
├── shared/
└── dev-run.js
```
